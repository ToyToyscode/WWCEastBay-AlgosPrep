#Exercises for WWC East Bay Problemset

Welcome to our first Women who Code East Bay Algorithms Prep.  Each week we will tackle a different common Algorithm/ Data Structure.

Feel free to work with a partner on these problems.  And we will come back to share our solutions.  

##Monday, Nov 14th -Recursion

###What is Recursion?
  It is simply when a function calls it self.

###Where do you see it?
1. Recursive Functions (Any function that calls itself)
2. Recursive Algorithms (ex. Sorting Algorithms)
3. Recursive Data Structures (ex.Trees -- trees that are composed into smaller trees and etc...)

###Why Recurison?
  - Provides an elegant solution to key your code D.R.Y.(Don't Repeat Yourself) 
  - Basic/Expected CS knowledge!
  
###How do we tackle a recursive problem?
<hr>

First we need to understand that happens when a function calls itself:

IMG!!

We can see in this example that the function hello() is calling itself and it is excuting itself infinitely.


####What do we need to do in order for us to stop it?

We need to provide some way for us to BREAK it or RETURN a VALUE.
This in other words this is called a `base case`:

IMG!!!

####Procdure:

1. Identify the Base Case
2. Identify the Recursive Case
3. Return where appropriate
4. Write procedures for each case that brings you closer to the base case
 

##Problems-- (You should use recursion for all of these):
1. Intro to Recursion: (easy)

2. Reversing a String (easy)


3. Factorial(easy)


3. Fibbanocci Sequence (easy - med)
 
 
4. Greatest Common Denominator (med - hard)

5. Permutations (med - hard)

##Finished?
CONGRATS!! Give yourself a pat on the back, you must be super comfortable with recursion!

CONGRATS GIPHY!!

Feel free to look at the Women Who Code San Francisco Interview problems to practice more!

##Looking for Volunteers!

If you guys are interested in Volunteering for WWC East Bay Algorithms Prep:

Please email: **chylau.design@gmail.com**  with the subject line **"Interested in Volunteering--WWC East Bay AlgosPrep"** and write a short blurb about yourself, your programming experience, and why you would love to volunteer!  


**Disclaimer:**
Most of the material I've used is a combination of workshop classes that I've take in the past.  I cannot take credit for the things here.  Programs that have contributed to this repo:  General Assembly, Frontend Masters/ Telegraph Academy-@bgando
